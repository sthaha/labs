# ðŸ§ª Labs using Svelte and P5.js

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### What works
- [x] Integrate `p5.js` with `svelte` to create a [Canvas] component that
      responds to resizing
- [x] Configure 3D / WebGL
- [x] Use tailwind for styling and responsive layout
- [x] [Publish as a GH page][gh-pages]


### Todo
- [ ] test typings
- [ ] configure rollup bundle

  > **For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like
  [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle][plugin-rollup-bundle] to `snowpack.config.json` config file.
