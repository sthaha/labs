# Svelte Template for P5.js

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

Here is a template I intent to use to publish projects that I tryout using
processing.js

What works
- [x] include p5.js as an npm dependency
- [x] styling using tailwind
- [x] Configure 3D / WebGL to fit properly into a parent div
- [x] [publish to github.io](https://p5js.svelte.gh.thaha.xyz/)

Todo
- [ ] test typings

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
